# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Analyzes text files at the specified filepath and prints a report of character frequencies; sample open-source text file [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1342/pg1342.txt)

Steps to use:

1. clone the repository
2. open a command prompt and navigate to the repository
3. `python3 main.py FILEPATH_OF_YOUR_TXT_FILE`
